/**
 * You are building a Music Player app.
 * You need to implement the MusicPlayer class,
 * which should hold the track names as Strings in an array.
 * The array is already defined in the given code.
 * The player should support the following functions:
 *
 * add: add the given argument track to the tracks array.
 *
 * show: output all track names in the player on separate lines.
 *
 * play: start playing the first track by outputting "Playing name"
 * where name is the first track name.
 *
 * You can add a new item to an array using +=, for example: tracks += track
 *
 * The code in main takes track names from user input and calls the player functions.
