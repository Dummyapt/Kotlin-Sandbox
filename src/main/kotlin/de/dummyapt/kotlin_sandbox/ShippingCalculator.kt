/**
 * You are working on a eCommerce website and need to make a shipping cost
 * calculator based on the order amount.
 *
 * The store uses the following cost structure:
 *
 * For orders in the US:
 * - $75+ orders have free shipping
 * - orders less than $75 have a shipping fee of 10% of the total order amount.
 *
 * For international orders, there is a 15% shipping fee, with a maximum of $50.
 * This means that the maximum shipping fee for an international order is $50.
 *
 * You need to complete the given shippingCost() function, which takes
 * the order amount and a Boolean indicating whether the order is
 * international or not, and returns the shipping cost for that order.
 * The return amount should be a Double.
